I could see how someone would hear it as duple division, but to me this is a clear, and typically European lilt (especially the way she performs it). The issue it would seem is that the lilt is so slight that it sounds almost straight, but it's not straight enough to be straight (like a Dixie swing). There is a swung, or lilting character here that simply does not jibe at all with a straight hearing (again, in my opinion, of course). This is why I have my basic tapping value as a dotted quarter (this dotted quarter shows as a quarter in the transcription).",5,Dance,Europe,

All the rest of those notes throughout are certainly closer to C#...But I'm guessing your going by the system of choosing the first reference point in the recording regardless to keep it more scientifically sound.

Which gets to the next point: this melody sounds harmonic in nature (in that it outlines harmonies) and probably is typically sung with instruments, yes? Also although there is no meter to speak of in her rendition, this sounds like music that would normally be metrical. Perhaps she is just truncating certain beats since there is no ensemble that she needs to coordinate with in this solo rendition."

I found one stretch of almost 3 lines that is an almost exact repetition, rhythmically. Also there are stretches of the 1 2 3e+a motive (where the beat is 1/4 note), and the  segment starting on the second half of line 4 is immediately repeated.  But beyond that, I gave up It would be quite a memory feat for these guys to sing all of this without any macrometer. Maybe itâs improvised somehow? The stomping marks out a 6/2 meter, but it's hard to hear the vocals in relation to this. If there is a rhythmic pattern to the voices, it sure doesn't align with the 6/2 of the stomps.. I would not be surprised if there was some underlying scheme to this song, it would just take an emic perspective to solve for it most efficiently."

Also, the meter is fascinating. The first few phrases are clearly grouped into 7s, with a consistent deviation in the middle. Later, groups of 11 or 12 are prominent, before clear groups of 4 emerge with the very rapid tempo quarters near the end. I answered ""7"" and ""4"" for the macrometer since these were the two strongest emergent meters I heard. Also, there is one membrano-idio-phone instrument."
